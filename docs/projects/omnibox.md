OmniBox is a modular control case for 3D printers. It is derived from Steve Burcham's [similar project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3999751).

## Goals

OmniBox is designed to fit in the original footprint of Steve's cases with a more accessible, open layout. This layout leaves space for large boards, particularly BIGTREETECH's Octopus. Additionally, the OmniBox base is approximately 1.2" (30mm) shorter in overall height.

A major goal of this project is to entirely use panel mounted connections for external wiring. This saves approximately 1' (30cm) of wiring for every cable (estimated). With common pinouts for each connector on the panel, the control cases are theoretically interchangeable on the hardware level. 

Standardizing these connectors and their pin order is high on my list for a follow-on project.
