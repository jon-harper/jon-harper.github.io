This project is a modular, 3D-printable electronics case for 3D printers.

## Goals

OmniBox focuses on reusability, ease of service, and exceptional documentation. It aims to make the electronics case for your 3D printer as valuable and reusable an asset as the printer itself.

## Features

- Broad support for common hardware;
- Continuity and compatibility between releases (to be standardized with version 1.0);
- Rich, clear documentation:
    - Accessibly formatted;
    - Documentation for each release;
    - Full bill of materials;
    - Visual guided tour; and
    - Assembly guide with video overviews and illustrated, step-by-step instructions.
- Fusion 360 framework:
    - All parts are tagged with internal part numbers;
    - Bill of Material generation is partially automated through Python scripts;
    - Assembly is documented in the model;
    - Documentation illustrations and videos are generated by Fusion; and
    - Core model and many assemblies are textured for realistic promotional renders.

## Status

As of February 2023, OmniBox has six public releases; v0.9.9 is the most recent. It remains in active development, with a new release under development.
