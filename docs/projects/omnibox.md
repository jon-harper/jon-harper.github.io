This project is a modular, 3D-printable electronics case for 3D printers.

## Goals

OmniBox focuses on reusability, ease of service, and exceptional documentation. It aims to make the electronics case for your 3D printer as valuable and reusable an asset as the printer itself.

## Features

- A broad range of supported hardware;
- Design continuity between releases (to be standardized with version 1.0);
- Rich, clear documentation:
    - Accessible, plain format;
    - Versioned documentation;
    - A complete bill of materials; and
    - Illustrated assembly guide with video demonstrations;
- Fusion 360 framework:
    - All parts are tagged with internal part numbers;
    - BOM generation is partially automated through Python scripts;
    - Assembly is documented in the model;
    - Documentation illustrations and videos are generated by Fusion; and
    - Core model and many assemblies are textured for realistic promotional renders.

## Status

As of December 2022, OmniBox is on its sixth public release, v0.9.9. It is stable enough for everday use but remains under active development.
