Clock 3 is a prototype enclosed, CoreXY 3D printer. It is now used to generate new ideas for The Clockmaker Project.

## Goals

<!-- ![front render](../img/clock3/render1.png){width="300px"}

![side render with the panel off](../img/clock3/render2.png){width="300px"} -->

Clock 3 achieved several [development goals](https://jon-harper.github.io/clock-3/about/goals/):

- Ease of Sourcing
- Ease of Servicing
- Flexibility, Safety, and Stability

## Status

Fusion 360 data corruption halted immediate further work, but directly led to the development of [OmniBox][omnibox] and [The Clockmaker Project][clockmaker].
