## Goals

Clock 3 has specific [development goals](https://jon-harper.github.io/clock-3/about/goals/) that it has largely achieved:

- Ease of Sourcing
- Ease of Servicing
- Flexibility, Safety, and Stability

It is currently past the prototype stage and in a steady cycle if iterative fixes and improvements.

## Details

- [Project Page and Documentation](https://jon-harper.github.io/clock-3)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-3)

## Status

There is a complete, working prototype and a Bill of Materials (BOM) generation script. Significant work is complete to document setup and configuration.

Fusion 360 data corruption issues are currently delaying the release of CAD files and a full BOM.
