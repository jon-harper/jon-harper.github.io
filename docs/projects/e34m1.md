This is a project to adapt the [EVA 3](https://main.eva-3d.page/) toolhead for the [ZeroG Mercury One](https://docs.zerog.one/) project.

E34M1 is an abbreviation of "EVA 3 for Mercury One".

## Goals

- Maintain compatibility with EVA 3 for hotends and extruders.
- Make EVA 3 functional on Mercury One with as few restrictions as possible.
- Replace features present in stock EVA 3 that were broken by compatibility changes.
- Adapt parts normally included with Mercury One for EVA 3, as needed.
- Add support for stepper mounted breakout boards.
- Simplify the Bill of Materials by using Mercury One heat set inserts.

## Status

E34M1 is released and documentation is available.
