The Clockmaker Project is a repository of tools and guides for enclosed 3D printing.

"Clockmaker" is a reference to an antagonist in the Alastair Reynolds novel *The Prefect*. The Clockmaker is innately dangerous but is set after a noble task in the end. This strikes me as a parallel for the hazards of enclosed 3D printing.

"Devil in Chrome" is a phrase that describes The Clockmaker character in *The Prefect*. Every maker has at some point felt that a 3D printer is a devil in chrome that requires their effort, time and attention. The Clockmaker Project focuses on consolidating information for makers to save time and frustration.

## Goals

- Share tools for building and using enclosures;
- Adapt Clock 3's filtration for general use;
- Consolidate other Clock 3 features in one place; and
- Document tools for wire harness fabrication.

## Status

This project is still in initial stages.
