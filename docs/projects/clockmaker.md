The Clockmaker Project is a repository of tools and guides for enclosed 3D printing.

## Goals

- Share tools for building and using enclosures;
- Adapt Clock 3's filtration for general use;
- Consolidate other Clock 3 features in one place; and
- Document tools for wire harness fabrication.

## Status

This project is still in initial stages. Content is added as it is completed but may still need revision and editing for accuracy and content.
