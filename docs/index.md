Hello. My name is Jon Harper. My online handle is generally [jonspaceharper](contact.md).

This site a central place to post or link to my various projects and articles.

## About Me

I'm an IT-oriented problem solver. Things I love:

- writing to document and educate;
- teaching and discussing ideas and concepts;
- designing 3D printable, practical solutions;
- developing in C++ and reading about the nuances of the language;
- scripting in Python to simplify tasks;
- the "ah-ha!" of understanding and sharing that feeling with others.

You can find out more on my [about page](about.md). My [contact page](contact.md) also has links to my [LinkedIn bio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonspaceharper/) and other professional social media accounts.

## Projects

I actively maintain a few medium-to-large projects and have many more smaller ones.

### [OmniBox](projects/omnibox.md)

A modular, 3D-printable electronics case for 3D printers. OmniBox focuses on reusability and ease of service.

As of December 2022, OmniBox is on its sixth public release, v0.9.9.

Features:

- A broad range of supported hardware;
- Design continuity between releases (to be standardized with version 1.0);
- Rich, full documentation:
    - Illustrated assembly guide with video demonstrations;
    - Versioned documentation;
    - A complete bill of materials; and
    - A clear, accessible format.
- Fusion 360 framework:
    - All parts are tagged with internal part numbers;
    - BOM generation is partially automated through Python scripts;
    - Assembly is documented in the model;
    - Documentation illustrations and videos are generated by Fusion; and
    - Core model and many assemblies are textured for realistic promotional renders.

### [Clock 3](projects/clock3.md)

A prototype enclosed, CoreXY 3D printer. Clock 3 development stopped due to corrupted Fusion archives. It is now used to generate new ideas for The Clockmaker Project.

This project includes:
- More than 100 unique printed parts;
- Integrated HEPA and activated charcoal filtration;
- Script-based Bill of Materials generation;
- Panel-mounted connectors and extensive wiring planning; and

Tools adapted from Clock 3:

- [clock-face](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-face): a modified Klipper display to show enclosure temperature
- [clock3-klipper](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock3-klipper): Klipper configuration delegation via git
- [Clock3Scripts](https://github.com/jon-harper/Clock3Scripts): Fusion 360 Python plugin for automatical bill of materials generation

### [The Clockmaker Project](projects/clockmaker.md)

Tools for enclosed 3D printing. The Clockmaker Project documents:

- Wiring harness fabrication
- 3D printer enclosure considerations
- Filtration

<!--## Articles

I occasionally put thoughts down about 3D printing, where it is heading, and my projects. You can find the list of articles on the menu to the left, or [follow me on LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/jonspaceharper) for more.
