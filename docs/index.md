I'm a technology- and information-oriented problem solver. I love to:

- **write** to document and educate;
- **teach** and discuss ideas and concepts;
- **design** 3D printable, practical solutions;
- **develop** in C++ and learn the nuances of the language;
- **script** in Python to simplify tasks; and
- **learn** new technologies and ideas.

You can find out more on my [about page](about.md).
