Hello. My name is Jon Harper. My online handle is generally [jonspaceharper](contact.md).

This site a central place to post or link to my various projects and articles.

## About Me

I'm an IT-oriented problem solver. Things I love:

- writing to document and educate;
- teaching and discussing ideas and concepts;
- designing 3D printable, practical solutions;
- developing in C++ and reading about the nuances of the language;
- scripting in Python to simplify tasks;
- the "ah-ha!" of understanding and sharing that feeling with others.

You can find out more on my [about page](about.md). My [contact page](contact.md) also has links to my [LinkedIn bio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonspaceharper/) and other professional social media accounts.

## Projects

I actively maintain a few medium-to-large projects and have many more smaller ones.

### [OmniBox](projects/omnibox.md)

A modular, 3D-printable electronics case for 3D printers.

### [Clock 3](projects/clock3.md)

An advanced prototype of a enclosed, CoreXY 3D printer. Clock 3 is often used to generate new ideas for The Clockmaker Project.

This project includes:
- More than 100 unique printed parts
- Integrated HEPA and activated charcoal filtration

Tools adapted from Clock 3:

- [clock-face](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-face): a modified Klipper display to show enclosure temperature
- [clock3-klipper](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock3-klipper): Klipper configuration management via git repository
- [Clock3Scripts](https://github.com/jon-harper/Clock3Scripts): Fusion 360 Python plugin for automatical bill of materials generation

### [The Clockmaker Project](projects/clockmaker.md)

A combination of documented journey into enclosed 3D printing and tools for the job.

### Others

You can find other projects on my [GitHub]("https://github.com/jon-harper?tab=repositories") and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/jonspaceharper/designs) profiles.

<!--## Articles

I occasionally put thoughts down about 3D printing, where it is heading, and my projects. You can find the list of articles on the menu to the left, or [follow me on LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/jonspaceharper) for more.
