Hello. This is a central place to post or link to my various projects and articles. 

## About Me

My name is Jon Harper.

I'm an IT-oriented problem solver. Things I love:

- writing for both documentation and education;
- training, teaching, and discussing ideas and concepts;
- designing 3D printable, practical solutions;
- developing in C++ and reading about the nuances of the language;
- scripting in Python to simplify tasks;
- the understanding feeling of "ah-ha!" and sharing that with others.

I rambled a bit more about myself on this [about page](about.md)

## Contacting Me

My online handle is generally [jonspaceharper](contact.md).

## Projects

I actively maintain a few medium-to-large projects and have many more smaller ones.

### [Clock 3](projects/clock3.md)

I designed, prototyped, and continue to develop an enclosed 3D printer.

### [OmniBox](projects/omnibox.md)

A modular control case for 3D printers.

### Others

You can find other projects on my [GitHub]("https://github.com/jon-harper?tab=repositories") or [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/jonspaceharper/designs) profiles.

<!--## Articles

I occasionally put thoughts down about 3D printing, where it is heading, and my projects. You can find the list of articles on the menu to the left, or [follow me on LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/jonspaceharper) for more.
