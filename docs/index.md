Hello. My name is Jon Harper. My online handle is generally [jonspaceharper](contact.md).

This site a central place to post or link to my various projects and articles.

## About Me

I'm an IT-oriented problem solver. Things I love:

- writing to document and educate;
- teaching and discussing ideas and concepts;
- designing 3D printable, practical solutions;
- developing in C++ and reading about the nuances of the language;
- scripting in Python to simplify tasks;
- the "ah-ha!" of understanding and sharing that feeling with others.

You can find out more on my [about page](about.md). My [contact page](contact.md) also has links to my [LinkedIn bio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonspaceharper/) and other professional social media accounts.

## Projects

I actively maintain several projects.

- [OmniBox](projects/omnibox.md): modular 3D-printed electronics case
- [Clock 3](projects/clock3.md): prototype enclosed 3D printer
- [The Clockmaker Project](projects/clockmaker.md): tools and guides for enclosed 3D printing

### Others

You can find other projects on my [GitHub]("https://github.com/jon-harper?tab=repositories") and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/jonspaceharper/designs) profiles.

<!--## Articles

I occasionally put thoughts down about 3D printing, where it is heading, and my projects. You can find the list of articles on the menu to the left, or [follow me on LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/jonspaceharper) for more.
