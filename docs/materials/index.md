## Overview


Patents

- patents in 2009 made 3d printing possible
- further patent expirations expanded possibilities
- enthusiasts developed new techniques and approaches

Materials

- 3d printing transforms thermoplastic materials
- Materials have strengths/weaknesses
- Materials also have printing requirements
- Materials have cost

## Background

Thermoplastics

- Thermoplastics ('plastics') are made into filament from resins.
- Used in injection molding and other heat-forming methods
- LEGOs to plastic bottles
- High end plastics resist extreme conditions
- Used in car parts, medical devices

Common Examples

- PLA: Food packaging, biodegradable medical implants
- ABS: Toys, equipment housings, musical instruments
- PET/PETG: Food and drink containers, microfiber cloths
- ASA: Automotive and home exterior trim
- PMMA (acrylic): Windows and lenses, furniture, transparent signage
- PA 6 & PA 6,6 (Nylon 6 & Nylon 66): Automotive parts, electrical connectors, sports equipment
- PA 12 (Nylon 12): Chemically-resistent functional parts in medical & industrial applications
- PC (polycarbonate): Eye protection, eyeglass lenses, bulletproof glass

## 3D Printing

Filament

- Filaments are continuous cylinders carefully measured for their roundness.
- Filament is rolled onto spools for sale.
- Out-of-spec filament extrudes too much or too little plastic.

Printing

- Functions much like a mechanical cake decorator that works in layers (like a bricklayer).
- Toolhead is the part that prints.
- The surface is prints on is the build plate.

Extrusion

- Filament enters heater block through heatbreak.
- Inside the heatbreak is a melt zone where filament liquifies.
- Pushing in more filament squeezes the excess out of the nozzle.
- Nozzle size, temperature, and physical size of the melt zone limits how much can be extruded at once.
- Careful control of nozzle pressure allows varying line widths, height, and rapid starts and stops.

## Requirements

**Nozzle Temperature**

The maximum temperature nozzle can safely reach, minus a safety factor.

**Bed Temperature**

A heated bed keeps the build plate hot enough that filament touching it becomes tacky, improving adhesion.

**Build Plate Coating**

Materials are chosen that plastics adhere well to. Release agents may be used to improve adhesion when heated and release when cooled. The most common release agent is a glue stick.

Most coatings are PEI, but other chemicals are used to provide better adhesion with specific materials.

**Air Temperature**

Higher air temperatures reduce shrinkage during cooling for many materials. The most common air temperature control method is an enclosure (see below).

**Part cooling fan(s)**

blasts extruded plastic with air to rapidly cool it. This helps set some plastics, particularly in cases where extruded plastic is not fully supported from underneath.

**Air Filtration**

Activated carbon captures smells and toxins. HEPA filters are used to capture micro-plastics and anything that remains.

**Enclosure**

An enclosed print environment protects prints from temperature changes, allows higher air temperatures,
and prevents dust and dirt from contaminating the printer. Enclosures range from helpful to required, depending on the material in use.

Enclosures and air temperature control are often integrated, and higher-quality enclosures have insulation and/or better cladding to decrease heat loss.

## Materials

### Categories

#### Consumer/Entry-Level Plastics

These materials are the most forgiving to print with the lowest print requirements. None require an enclosure. They are typically made from resin formulated for printability. These materials typically do not require print temperatures over 250C.

- PLA (polylactic acid)
- PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol)
- TPU (thermoelastic polyurethane)

#### Engineering Plastics

These are widely used commercial plastics. They generally require an enclosure, heated beds above 90C, and air temperatures above 40C.

- ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)
- ASA (acrylonitrile budadient acrylate)
- PA (Nylon, polyamide)
- PC (polycarbonate)
- PP (polypropylene)

#### High-end Plastics

High-end plastics require printers specifically engineered to handle extreme conditions, including air temperatures over 100C. Print temperatures often exceed 400C.

- PTFE (Teflon, polytetraflouroethylene)
- PEEK (polyether ether ketone)
- PEI (Ultem, polyetherimide)
- PMMA (Acrylic, Plexiglass, poly(methyl methacrylate))
