!!! note "[Looking for my resume?](resume.md)"

I first acquired a 3D printer in late 2019, and along with it, an interest in CAD. My dryer received a new, 3D-printed handle while I retired the metal coat hanger from its prior duties. I soon designed a [wall-mount for my hair trimmer](https://www.printables.com/model/354664-corded-electric-hair-trimmer-holder) and a [mount for the blades](https://www.printables.com/model/354663-wahl-hair-clipper-guard-holder), too.

Printing functional parts naturally fostered an interest in engineering plastics (such as ABS) that must be printed in enclosures. Six months later, I completed a wooden enclosure, and I continue to explore the possibilities of printing new materials. My free time now focuses on designing and documenting modular, easy to service 3D printers, wiring harnesses, and enclosures.

## Background

My family has a page layout and publishing business. By sixteen, I had a working knowledge of the Microsoft Office suite, Photoshop, and how to maintain and troubleshoot a small business network.

I studied Computer Science and English at The University of Texas at Dallas, where I cultivated a love of C++ and problem solving. In the years since, I extended my interest to UI design, iconography, and typography. I began developing in Python in 2010 to prototype user interfaces and automate everyday tasks.

During the early-to-mid 2010s, I developed several tools in C++ using the Qt Framework. After looking for a cross-platform solution for documenting both C++ and Python, I learned Doxygen.

My background in page layout, interest in UX, and writing experience created a fascination with good documentation. I love the content-rich, clean documentation of the [Qt Project](https://doc.qt.io/qt.html) and the language-oriented natural feel of [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).

**I strive to make documentation that I want to use.**

In 2021, I stepped away from my two longtime roles to spend one year preparing for a career pivot to documentation and design. I naturaly documented the projects that resulted, from an [enclosed 3D printer](projects/clock3.md)--that is still a prototype--to the [3D printer electronics case](projects/omnibox.md) that has dozens of users.

Along with 3D design, composing documentation with Markdown (and a bit of HTML & CSS) is part of my day-to-day.

## Interests

### Software Development

I enjoy studying the growth and change of the C++ programming language standard, as well as the detailed nuances of the language. I still visit [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4732082/jonspaceharper) to find interesting problems and solutions.

I have a fascination with the Windows Explorer tree and the COM architecture behind it. I've extended this interest to my book library--Don Box makes excellent bedtime reading.

### General

I enjoy good use of fonts and icons and minimalism in design. I am an avid fan of history, reading, and general wordsmithing. Aeronautical engineering, particularly aerospace, is a longtime area of interest.

My work experience crosses between IT and the service industry. As a result, I have a strong belief in cross-training and "walking in the other person's shoes".

See [my resume](resume.md) for more.

<!-- ### Problem Solving, Troubleshooting, & Analysis

I am often presented tasks that are out of the ordinary. 

- As a Shift Supervisor at Souper! Salad! and in conjuction with my SM and District Manager, my store was tasked with trialing a training program; I was asked to lead this effort as a trainer.
- After becoming Assistant Store Manager at Souper! Salad!, I developed two cost tracking spreadsheets that were later used company-wide or adapted for use company-wide.
- At Starbucks as a Shift Supervisor, I was asked by an SM to assist with a store opening that was behind schedule. After remodels or before new store openings, on several occasions I was delegated some or all of the store layout.
- Later at Starbucks and in conjunction with my SM, my store trialed using an older bar layout ("double bar") than was standard at the time ("wing bar") for stores with only 2 espresso bars. Our conversations with the Regional Manager at the time and the success of the new layout resulted in this being adopted moving forward. I do not know the extent to which the company took this up, but my local Starbucks still arranges new stores in the double bar layout. In hard numbers, our customer throughput increased 33% in approximately a month.

### Service Industry

I have nearly 20 years of experience in the service industry, including 12 years with Starbucks Coffee Company. Along the way, I developed a strong empathy for the customer and met lifelong friends. I also gained experience in a number of areas:

- Ordering and Inventory Management: for five years and at two different stores, I had responsibility for the weekly delivery order, backroom layout, and inventory levels.
- Efficiency & Calm: working in high-volume Starbucks stores requires constant focus and attention to detail.
- Cultivating and Uplifting Others: a trainee succeeds or fails based on the support they are given. No one new should ever feel they are without someone to ask for help.

### Teaching and Training

I love teaching and training.

During my time with Starbucks, I trained an somewhere between twenty-five and forty current and former Starbucks Partners, some of whom went on to become Store Managers. Other trainers often asked me to introduce new partners to the espresso bar or specific maintenance and cleaning tasks. 

I often coached nervous partners with their speech in Drive Thru and how to call drinks in the cafe to be heard over the ambient noise. -->
