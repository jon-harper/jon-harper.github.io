![What I May or May Not Look Like](img/doug.png){ data-title="I Kinda Look Like This" data-description="Sorta." width="250px" align="right" }

In 2019, I acquired a used 3D printer. I took quickly to making practical solutions. I gave my dryer a 3D printed handle and retired the metal coat hanger from its role, created a [wall-mount for my hair trimmer](https://www.printables.com/model/354664-corded-electric-hair-trimmer-holder) and a [mount for the blades, too](https://www.printables.com/model/354663-wahl-hair-clipper-guard-holder).

Six months later, I completed a  wooden enclosure with the goal of printing ABS. That particular enclosure didn't work out, but the fascination with practical tools that are easy to service lives on.

My free time now focuses on designing and documenting modular, easy to service 3D printers, wiring harnesses, and enclosures.

## Background

My family has a page layout and publishing business. By sixteen, my working knowledge covered the Microsoft Office suite, Photoshop, and how to maintain and troubleshoot a small business network.

I studied Computer Science and Literature at The University of Texas at Dallas. Life took me in another direction, but I cultivated an ongoing love of C++ and problem solving. In the years since, I studied UI design and UX, iconography, and typography. I learned Python around 2010 to prototype user interfaces and write simple desktop scripts.

During the early-to-mid 2010s, I developed several tools in C++ using the Qt Framework. I picked up Doxygen as a cross-platform solution for documenting both C++ and Python. In the late '10s, my interests keyed in on embedded applications. This dovetailed well when 3D printing became a hobby, along with a knowledge of Python.

Along with 3D design, composing documentation in Markdown (and a bit of HTML/CSS) is part of my day-to-day.

## Interests

### Software Development

I enjoy the growth and change of the C++ programming language standard, as well as the more abstract nuances of the language. I occasionally still visit [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4732082/jonspaceharper) to find interesting problems and solutions.

I have a peculiar fascination with the Windows Explorer tree and the COM architecture behind it. I've extended this interest to my library--Don Box makes excellent bedtime reading.

### General

I am an avid fan of history, reading, and general wordsmithing.

I enjoy good use of fonts and icons and minimalism in design.

## Professional Experience

My work experience crosses between IT and the service industry. I have a strong belief in cross-training and "walking in the other person's shoes for a day" as a result.

### Problem Solving, Troubleshooting, & Analysis

I am often presented tasks that are out of the ordinary. 

- As a Shift Supervisor at Souper! Salad! and in conjuction with my SM and District Manager, my store was tasked with trialing a training program; I was asked to lead this effort as a trainer.
- After becoming Assistant Store Manager at Souper! Salad!, I developed two cost tracking spreadsheets that were later used company-wide or adapted for use company-wide.
- At Starbucks as a Shift Supervisor, I was asked by an SM to assist with a store opening that was behind schedule. After remodels or before new store openings, on several occasions I was delegated some or all of the store layout.
- Later at Starbucks and in conjunction with my SM, my store trialed using an older bar layout ("double bar") than was standard at the time ("wing bar") for stores with only 2 espresso bars. Our conversations with the Regional Manager at the time and the success of the new layout resulted in this being adopted moving forward. I do not know the extent to which the company took this up, but my local Starbucks still arranges new stores in the double bar layout. In hard numbers, our customer throughput increased 33% in approximately a month.

### Service Industry

I have nearly 20 years of experience in the service industry, including 12 years with Starbucks Coffee Company. Along the way, I developed a strong empathy for the customer and met lifelong friends. I also gained experience in a number of areas:

- Ordering and Inventory Management: for five years and at two different stores, I had responsibility for the weekly delivery order, backroom layout, and inventory levels.
- Efficiency & Calm: working in high-volume Starbucks stores requires constant focus and attention to detail.
- Cultivating and Uplifting Others: a trainee succeeds or fails based on the support they are given. No one new should ever feel they are without someone to ask for help.

### Teaching and Training

I love teaching and training.

During my time with Starbucks, I trained an somewhere between twenty-five and forty current and former Starbucks Partners, some of whom went on to become Store Managers. Other trainers often asked me to introduce new partners to the espresso bar or specific maintenance and cleaning tasks. 

I often coached nervous partners with their speech in Drive Thru and how to call drinks in the cafe to be heard over the ambient noise.
