My online handle is generally jonspaceharper . This site a central place to post or link to my various projects and articles. About Me I'm an IT-oriented problem solver. Things I love: writing to document and educate; teaching and discussing ideas and concepts; designing 3D printable, practical solutions; developing in C++ and reading about the nuances of the language; scripting in Python to simplify tasks; the \"ah-ha!\" of understanding and sharing that feeling with others. You can find out more on my about page . My contact page also has links to my LinkedIn bio and other professional social media accounts. Projects I actively maintain a few medium-to-large projects and have many more smaller ones. OmniBox A modular, 3D-printable electronics case for 3D printers. Clock 3 An advanced prototype of a enclosed, CoreXY 3D printer. Clock 3 is often used to generate new ideas for The Clockmaker Project. This project includes: - More than 100 unique printed parts - Integrated HEPA and activated charcoal filtration Tools adapted from Clock 3: clock-face : a modified Klipper display to show enclosure temperature clock3-klipper : Klipper configuration management via git repository Clock3Scripts : Fusion 360 Python plugin for automatical bill of materials generation The Clockmaker Project A combination of documented journey into enclosed 3D printing and tools for the job. Others You can find other projects on my GitHub and Thingiverse profiles.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"I'm an IT-oriented problem solver.

I started with a used, clone-of-a-clone 3D printer and a willingness to learn and experiment. A few months later, I started designing a wooden enclosure. My work has grown and focused modular, easy to service printers and enclosures. In February of 2021, I began designing an enclosed 3D printer. 16 months and 3 major designs later, my prototype first printed ABS plastic in a fully enclosed environment, complete with air filtration and temperature control. Background I grew up surrounded by the computers of my mom's desktop publishing and operations management business. At sixteen, I knew the Microsoft Office suite, Photoshop, and how to maintain and troubleshoot a small business network. I studied Computer Science and Literature at UTD for several years. Life took me in another direction, but I continued to cultivate a love of C++ and problem solving. I spent several years studying and experimenting with UI/UX, iconography, and typography in my spare time. I later learned Python 3 to handle quick scripts and prototype new user interfaces. Interests Software Development I enjoy following the growth and change of the C++ programming language standard, as well as the more abstract nuances of the language. I occasionally still visit Stack Overflow to find interesting problems and solutions. General I am an avid fan of history, reading, and writing. Professional Experience Problem Solving, Troubleshooting, & Analysis I am often presented tasks that are out of the ordinary. As a Shift Supervisor at Souper! Salad! and in conjuction with my SM and District Manager, my store was tasked with trialing a training program; I was asked to lead this effort as a trainer. After becoming Assistant Store Manager at Souper! Salad!, I developed two cost tracking spreadsheets that were later used company-wide or adapted for use company-wide. At Starbucks as a Shift Supervisor, I was asked by an SM to assist with a store opening that was behind schedule. After remodels or before new store openings, on several occasions I was delegated some or all of the store layout. Later at Starbucks and in conjunction with my SM, my store trialed using an older bar layout (\"double bar\") than was standard at the time (\"wing bar\") for stores with only 2 espresso bars. Our conversations with the Regional Manager at the time and the success of the new layout resulted in this being adopted moving forward. I do not know the extent to which the company took this up, but my local Starbucks still arranges new stores in the double bar layout. In hard numbers, our customer throughput increased 33% in approximately a month. Service Industry I gained extensive experience in the service industry, including 12 years with Starbucks Coffee Company. Along the way, I developed a strong empathy for the customer and met lifelong friends. I also gained experience in a number of areas: Ordering and Inventory Management: responsible under two managers at different stores over a period of five years for weekly delivery order, backroom layout, and inventory levels. Calm Efficiency: working in high-volume Starbucks stores requires constant, uninterrupted focus and attention to detail. Cultivating and Uplifting Others: today's trainee succeeds or fails based on the support they are given. No one new should ever feel they are without someone to ask for help. Teaching and Training I love teaching and training. During my time with Starbucks, I: trained an estimated 25-40 current and former Starbucks Partners, some of whom went on to become Store Managers (SMs). Other trainers often asked me to introduce new partners to how the espresso bar works or to explain specific maintenance and cleaning tasks. I also often helped nervous partners with their speech in Drive Thru or while calling drinks in the cafe so that they could be heard over the ambient noise.","title":"About Me"},{"location":"about/#background","text":"I grew up surrounded by the computers of my mom's desktop publishing and operations management business.
